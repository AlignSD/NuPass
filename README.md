## User Story

Hey! I'm Evan Alioto. I'm currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCSD Extension. I've always had the desire to learn how to code but never had anyone around me to help direct me, so I decided to just jump straight into it. So far I've been having a blast and the content I've been learning has helped affirm my desires to get into coding. My goals with all of this is to switch careers in order to pursue something I'm passionate about. I hope you enjoy my portfolio page and please don't be afraid to reach out! Thank you for your time.

## Description

My homework for the week was to create a password generator that allowed the user to choose a password between 8 and 128 characters long. After the user decides the legnth they are then prompted with 3 questions about what type of characters they would like to include in their generated password (lowercase alphabet, Uppercase alphabet, and Special Characters.)
After the user makes their choice a password is generated in the text area. This projected helped teach me about the DOM aspect of JavaScript, Taking the variables from user choice and displaying a result within a html element, Generating a fuction based off of a button click, among other things.
